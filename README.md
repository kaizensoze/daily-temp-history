The goal of this project is to take a history of daily average temperatures in various cities throughout the world
and make it easily searchable.

Each city is a text file and each line in the text file is of the format:

month | day | year | average daily temp |
------|-----|------|--------------------|
1     | 3   | 1995 | -99                |
8     | 15  | 2000 | 78.8               |

where -99 is a placeholder for missing data
